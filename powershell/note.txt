There seems to be two powershell profiles used
- C:\Users\zhiyu\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\profile.ps1
- C:\Users\zhiyu\Documents\PowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1

Troubleshoots:
- sometimes you need to make sure that the powershell toy is start as admin if you want to launch using that
- make sure %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps is in path
